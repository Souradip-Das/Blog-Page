      <p>The Ellora Caves are a group of 34 rock-cut temples and monasteries located in the Aurangabad district of Maharashtra, India. These caves were built between the 6th and 10th centuries AD, during the reigns of the Kalachuri, Rashtrakuta, and Yadava dynasties. The caves were created by carving into the basalt rock of the Charanandri Hills, and were used as temples, monasteries, and prayer halls by followers of Hinduism, Buddhism, and Jainism.

        The construction of the Ellora Caves began in the 6th century AD, with the building of the Buddhist caves. The Hindu caves were built during the 7th and 8th centuries, while the Jain caves were constructed in the 9th and 10th centuries. The construction of the caves was a remarkable feat of engineering, as the builders had to carve into the hard basalt rock using only hammers and chisels.
        
        The Ellora Caves are renowned for their intricate carvings and sculptures, which depict various gods, goddesses, and religious scenes from Hindu, Buddhist, and Jain traditions. Some of the most famous caves include the Kailasa Temple, which is the largest monolithic structure in <span id="dots2">...</span><span id="more2">the world, and the Jain Cave 32, which has some of the most detailed and delicate carvings in the entire complex.

      <h2><u>Konark Sun Temple, Odisha</u></h2>
      <div class="container">
        <img src="images/sun-temple.JPG">
        <p>The Konark Sun Temple is a UNESCO World Heritage Site located in the eastern Indian state of Odisha. It is a 13th-century temple dedicated to the Hindu sun god Surya, and is known for its architectural grandeur and intricate stone carvings.

          The construction of the temple is attributed to King Narasimhadeva I of the Eastern Ganga Dynasty, who ruled from 1238 to 1264 CE. It is said that the temple was built to commemorate the king's military victories, and as a symbol of his devotion to the sun god.
          
          The temple's design is based on the shape of a colossal chariot, with 24 wheels, pulled by seven horses. The temple is oriented towards the east, so that the first rays of the sun illuminate the sanctum sanctorum. The temple's main sanctum sanctorum was once surmounted by a huge tower, which has since collapsed, and today only the jagamohana (assembly hall) and the natamandapa (dance hall) survive.
          
          The temple is also known for its intricate stone carvings, which adorn the walls and pillars of the temple. These carvings depict various mythological scenes,<span id="dots5">...</span><span id="more5"> including scenes from the Mahabharata and the Ramayana. They also depict scenes of daily life, including hunting, farming, and cooking.
          
          The Konark Sun Temple was a major pilgrimage site during its time, and is still considered to be one of the most important temples in India. However, the temple's decline began in the 16th century, when it was attacked and partially destroyed by Muslim armies. The temple was eventually abandoned, and was covered by sand and vegetation. It was rediscovered by British surveyors in the 19th century, and efforts were made to restore and preserve the temple.
          
          Today, the Konark Sun Temple is one of the most visited tourist destinations in Odisha, and attracts visitors from all over the world. It is a testament to the architectural and artistic achievements of the Eastern Ganga Dynasty, and is a symbol of India's rich cultural heritage.</span><button onclick="myFunction5()" id="myBtn5">Read more</button></p>
